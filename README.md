# Aife: An Interactive Fiction Editor

"A" stands for "awesome", "another", "advanced", "A mark" or just an "an". "[Aife](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A%C3%ADfe)" is also nice name per se (pronounced as `[ˈiːfʲə]`).

Aife is spiritual fork of famous [Twine](http://twinery.org/), with which Aife intended to be compatible,
especially in early stages, especially in story formats. Main goal is to provide more dynamic and cloud-enabled story development.
